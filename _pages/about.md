Hi, I’m Sarah Martelly — a passionate advocate for equity, policy, and innovation at the intersection of law, technology, and global governance.

I’m currently pursuing a B.A. in Social Science with a concentration in Politics at NYU, where I maintain a 3.89 GPA and actively engage in legal research, policy analysis, and public service initiatives. My professional experience spans roles as a legal intern, legislative fellow, and research assistant, with a focus on issues like criminal justice reform, mental health advocacy, and international development.

On GitHub, I document and share work related to:
  Legal and policy research
  Public data analysis (Python, R, and Excel-based)
  Computational social science projects
  Advocacy campaign planning and program development
  Personal writing and professional development resources

My journey is shaped by resilience, service, and an unshakable commitment to transforming systems through data, policy, and people-first leadership. This GitHub is a reflection of the work I do — and the impact I hope to make.

Feel free to explore my repos, connect, or collaborate!
